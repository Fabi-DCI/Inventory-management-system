Technologies Used

    Python 3.x - The project is built using Python as the primary programming language.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Setup

    Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:Fabi-DCI/Inventory-management-system.git

Usage

    Add products to the inventory by creating Product instances and adding them via the add_product() method.

    Update the quantity of a product using the update_product_quantity() method.

    Remove products using the remove_product() method by specifying the product name.

    Get product information using get_product_info() with the product's name.

    Calculate the total inventory value using get_total_inventory_value().

Example usage in main.py:

# Create product instances
apple = Product("Apple", 0.50, 200, "Fruit")
milk = Product("Milk", 1.50, 50, "Dairy")

# Add products to inventory
inventory.add_product(apple)
inventory.add_product(milk)

# Get product information
print(inventory.get_product_info("Apple"))
